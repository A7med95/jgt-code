Sample code to draw antialiased lines as described in the Journal of
Graphic Tools article High Quality Hardware Line Antialiasing by
Scott R. Nelson of Sun Microsystems.

The code is written in C and designed to run on any machine with the
addition of a proper "display" module.  Currently, display modules
exist for Macintosh, Unix, and Wintel machines.  Thanks to Sanjay Gupta
(sanjay.gupta@eng.sun.com) for the Unix X11 display code and Chris
Babcock (babcock@rtp.idt.com) for the Windows code.

This code is not 100% bug free and is definitely not optimized for
performance.  It does, however, illustrate all of the points made in
the JGT article.
