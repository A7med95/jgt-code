Example Automatic Differentiation Source Code

Templates, and Photogrammetry" published in
the Journal of Graphics Tools, Vol 9, No. 4, 2004

The attached code may be used to compute up to third
derivatives of multivariate functions involving +, -,
* and exp().
Generalisation to more functions should be
straightforward.

Important note, this code is not "industrial strength".
It is example code to illustrate the methods discussed
in the paper. Some hints on how to make it industrial
strength are contained in the source code as comments.
