This archive contains the source code of a demo program showing the
appearance various pointsets on the surface of sphere and plane.
It also contains source codes listed in the paper "Sampling with 
Hammersley and Halton Points" published in the Journal of Graphics Tools.

System Requirement: UNIX platform with OpenGL (Mesa or SGI OpenGL), GLUT,
		    and X11.
		    OR
		    Windows with Visual C++ 6.0 or above, OpenGL and GLUT
