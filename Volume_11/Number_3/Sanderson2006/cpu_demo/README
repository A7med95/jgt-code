This code depends on the following functions from "Numerical Recipies
in C":

float ran1(long *idum);
float gasdev(long *idum);

float gammp(float a, float x);
float gammln(float xx);
void gser(float *gamser, float a, float x, float *gln);
void gcf(float *gammcf, float a, float x, float *gln);
void nrerror(char error_text[]);

The source code for these functions CAN NOT be distributed. I have
supplied the header files:

rand.h
gammp.h

Which has the function definitions. I put the C source code into two
files rand.c and gammp.c You will need to obtain the source code which
is verbatim from the book and accompanying software. See the two
skeleton files, rand_skeleton.c and gammp_skeleton.c for a template.


You will also need GLEW, GLUT, GLUI, GL libs which can be found on
their respective web sites (sourceforge). The GL libs should be
installed as part of the installation of the GPU driver.

When using the makefile it is necessary to set the environment
variable "OS" to be either "Linux" or "Darwin". FWIW - the variable
can be set by using the following "setenv OS `uname`"


How to run (AKA Really crappy instructions):

Adjust the parameters and see what you get. Just make sure you press
"Restart" so that everything is initalized properly.

The default underlying vector field is circular. So if you run it as
is a circluar tear drop spot pattern will form.

See my paper "Advanced Reaction-Diffusion Models for Texture
Synthesis" published in the Journal of Graphics Tools, 2006 for more
information on setting the paramenters.


If you have a spiffy new nVidia graphics card I would suggest you try the GPU
of the code as it does more like mixing of two models. 


Known bugs - there seems to be problems when switching between models so
             it is best to quit and restart.
