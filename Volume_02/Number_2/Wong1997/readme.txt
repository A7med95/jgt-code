Executable Demo

Two executable demonstration programs (sphere.gz and plane.gz) are available for download. Program sphere demonstrates the appearances of various Hammersley and Halton point sets on the sphere. Program plane demonstrates the appearances of various Hammersley and Halton point sets on the 2D plane. Both programs run on SGI IRIX with OpenGL. They are compressed by gzip.

Running instructions for both programs: When the program (both demo programs) starts, users can press key "1" - "9" and "A" - "B". Each key toggles the drawing of one point set (see the following table):

Key pressed	Point set being drawn or erased
1	Random points with uniform distribution.
2	Hammersley points with p1 = 2.
3	Hammersley points with p1 = 3.
4	Hammersley points with p1 = 5.
5	Hammersley points with p1 = 7.
6	Hammersley points with p1 = 11.
7	Halton points with p1 = 2, p2 = 3.
8	Halton points with p1 = 2, p2 = 5.
9	Halton points with p1 = 2, p2 = 7.
A	Halton points with p1 = 3, p2 = 5.
B	Halton points with p1 = 3, p2 = 7.
