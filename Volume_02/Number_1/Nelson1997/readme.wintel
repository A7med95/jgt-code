Instructions for creating the Windows version of aaline.

The file AALINE.EXE is an executable for Win32, kindly created by Chris
Babcock (babcock@rtp.idt.com).  It was compiled using Visual C++ 4.2.
He stated: "It may be compiled by [...] loading AALINE.MAK into Visual
C++ and doing a BUILD.  Left mouse button will exit."  Chris compiled
it with a gamma setting of 1.8.

The author appreciates how quickly Chris whipped this together.
