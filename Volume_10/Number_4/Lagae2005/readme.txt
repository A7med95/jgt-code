This program is a minimal ray tracer. It ray traces a single quad, covered
with a checkerboard texture, and outputs the image as "image.ppm".

The classes provided in this file are not complete, only operations needed
to implement the intersection algorithm and ray tracer are provided.

To compile and run:

  $ g++ erqit.cpp -o erqit
  $ ./erqit
