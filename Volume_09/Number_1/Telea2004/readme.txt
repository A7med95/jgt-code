Abstract

Digital inpainting provides a means for reconstruction of small damaged portions of an image. Although the inpainting basics are straightforward, most inpainting techniques published in the literature are complex to understand and implement. We present here a new algorithm for digital inpainting based on the fast marching method for level set applications. Our algorithm is very simple to implement, fast, and produces nearly identical results to more complex, and usually slower, known methods. Source code is available online.
