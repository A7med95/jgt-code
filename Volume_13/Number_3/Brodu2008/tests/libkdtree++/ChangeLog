libkdtree++ ChangeLog
=====================

2004-11-15  Martin F. Krafft (krafft@ailab.ch)

	- fixed numerous little bugs that led to compilation problems
	- changed code to compile cleanly with GCC 3.4 and GCC 4.0

2004-11-06  Martin F. Krafft (krafft@ailab.ch)

	- reverted to optimise() to prevent API change, and added an optimize()
	  passthrough method with an appropriate comment.

2004-11-05  Paul Harris (paulharris@computer.org)

	- Renamed optimise() to optimize().
	- Added a full set of range constructors and insert(range) methods.
		it now works with inserter(tree,tree.begin())
	- Target type no longer needs a default constructor. This also fixes
		problems with empty trees (would crash if optimized).
	- Some code cleanup (removed inlines, switched from const_iterator to
		iterator, added this-> to ensure the methods are called).
	- Added a new method: count_within_range().
	- Fixed bug in rend().

2004-11-04  Martin F. Krafft (krafft@ailab.ch)

	- Integrated patch by Paul Harris to fix a logic error pertaining to
		OutputIterators in find_within_range. find_within_range() now
		returns the output iterator instead of a count. Thanks, Paul!
	- Added another fix by Paul Harris to _M_get_j_max, which would cause
		a dimensional overflow for trees with depths >= K. Thanks (again) Paul!
	- Made some improvements to the autotools files.

2004-05-11  Martin F. Krafft (krafft@ailab.ch)

	- Fixed CFlags and Libs entries in pkgconfig file.

2004-05-11  Martin F. Krafft (krafft@ailab.ch)

	- Initial release.
